Advertisement site built with Django with multiple image upload per ad, Q&A forum, user-to-user messaging, searching and filtering ads etc. You need to make some changes to [django-messages](https://github.com/arneb/django-messages) and [django-authtools](https://github.com/fusionbox/django-authtools) because these libraries have not been upgraded to work with Django 3+.
